# Affixing Header&nbsp; [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/acusti/affixing-header.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/acusti/affixing-header)

Create an affixing header that behaves normally as a user navigates down a page, but reveals itself naturally when a user scrolls or drags upwards. Inspired by iOS Safari, Medium, and others.
